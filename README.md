<p> Our goal was to develop a real e-commerce website's checkout page for that project.
There is a cart for buying products, and we can increase or decrease the number of products. By
changing a parameter in the cart, our js functions calculate the cart total price. DOM, iterator, callback
functions, string-array functions and events are used in our page. Additionally, we can remove products
from the cart by clicking the remove button and decreasing the amount to "0". In that case, our page
asks us to delete the product from the cart. As soon as you confirm the deletion, the sour chart total is
recalculated by the js functions. Skills/Tools : DOM, Iterator, Callback functions, String-array functions
and Events.
